# Content management
## Drupal 7
The drupal 7 module is depending on [/maerts/views_languages_field](https://github.com/maerts/views_languages_field) and on [/maerts/views_operations_field](https://github.com/maerts/views_operations_field) for full functionality.
## Drupal 8
The rewrite in drupal 8 is bundled with all additional views fields and almost offers the same functionality as the D7 module.
